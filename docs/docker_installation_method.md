Install Docker Desktop from the official website (Windows / macOS) or Docker Engine (Linux)
After installation, open a terminal or command prompt to verify Docker
Run docker --version to confirm Docker is installed correctly
Pull the required Docker image using:
docker pull <image-name>
Create a new Docker container with the required ports and environment variables:
Example: docker run -d -p 5678:5678 --name n8n-container n8nio/n8n
Verify that the container is running using:
docker ps
Access the application in the browser using:
http://localhost:<port>
Configure volumes to ensure your data persists:
Example: -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n
Restart or stop the container if needed using:
docker restart n8n-container
docker stop n8n-container
Update the application by pulling a new image and recreating the container
Once setup is complete, your app runs fully on Docker with isolated environment and persistent data
